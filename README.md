I'm excited to share a few of the Python programs I developed during my studies. These are some of the programs I'm proud of, I selected these to showcase my skills. I hope you'll enjoy taking a look at them and getting a sense of my diversity of abilities. If you'd like to review any more code, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you for your interest!
